Reflection:
Flask is a web framework written in Python that makes it easier to develop web applications. Jinja allows you to pass Python variables into HTML templates easily, so variables can easily be used in HTML components. It also allows us to use for loops and if statements. Semantic UI is a development framework that lets us add styling directly to our html instead of creating a new css file. These technologies together make it easier to create different functions with different purposes on the same page and working with Python in html.
